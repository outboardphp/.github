## ðŸš¤ Outboard

### The Joy of Full Throttle.

**Outboard** is the powerful, well-designed engine for your PHP application.
Itâ€™s crafted around a handful of good principles, providing just the building blocks needed to realize the vision. The rest is in your hands.
Outboard's development is guided by an API-first mindset to ensure that you'll love using it and that your imagination is the only limit on what you can build.

**Outboard**'s purpose is to power the next wave of modern PHP application design in a way that acknowledges how the web has developed over the years, while also elevating your skill and understanding of advanced application architecture.

Specifically, it will support each of the following use cases equally well:
- Traditional websites where pages are fully generated in the backend
- API-only services
- Headless/decoupled websites where a backend API supports a fully-separate JS-powered frontend (e.g., SPAs)
- Modern websites where a full backend serves up a JS-powered frontend along with all the data needed to flesh out pages while handling the interactions for you (Inertia.js)

With **Outboard**, you're free to start enjoying the build.
