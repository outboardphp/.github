# Outboard Project Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the Outboard project. It applies to all “collaborative spaces”, which is defined as community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

It is assumed that all those who contribute in any way to this project are sufficiently mature to understand the following points and how to apply them.

- Act and speak in a way that brings honor to yourself and the project.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, always assume good intentions (good faith).
- Ensure that your language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks (i.e. ad hominems).
- Accordingly, make your best effort to debate issues fairly, avoiding common fallacies, in the interest of resolving material disagreements as efficiently as possible.
- Behavior which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
- Take arguments about topics unrelated to the project somewhere else.
- Spam will not be tolerated. All contributions should be constructive in some way.
